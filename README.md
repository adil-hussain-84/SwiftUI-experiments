# SwiftUI Experiments

This project houses a number of iOS applications which each demonstrate a particular aspect of SwiftUI.

The applications in this project are as follows:

|              |                                                                                                                                                                               |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [App1](App1) | A SwiftUI application which demonstrates how to push, present and dismiss SwiftUI Views.                                                                                      |
| [App2](App2) | A UIKit application which demonstrates that a SwiftUI view presented modally within a `UIHostingController` cannot be dismissed programmatically on iOS 14 and older devices. |
| [App3](App3) | A SwiftUI application which demonstrates how to display items in a `List` such that the items in the `List` change their appearance when tapped on pressed down.              |
| [App4](App4) | A SwiftUI application which demonstrates a custom rating view.                                                                                                                |
| [App5](App5) | A SwiftUI application which demonstrates how to write a UI test which interacts with a `DatePicker`.                                                                          |
| [App6](App6) | A SwiftUI application which demonstrates how to schedule asynchronous work when a `Button` is tapped.                                                                         |
| [App7](App7) | A SwiftUI application which demonstrates how to initialise an `ObservableObject` as a `StateObject` in a View's `init` method.                                                |
