# SwiftUI Experiments

This project houses a number of iOS applications which each demonstrate a particular aspect of SwiftUI.

The applications in this project are as follows:

|              |                                                                                                                                |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [App1](App1) | A SwiftUI application which demonstrates how to push, present and dismiss SwiftUI Views.                                       |
| [App2](App2) | A UIKit application which demonstrates a problem with presenting (i.e. modally) a `UIHostingController`.                       |
| [App3](App3) | A SwiftUI application which demonstrates how to display an array of tappable items in a `List`.                                |
| [App4](App4) | A SwiftUI application which demonstrates a custom rating view.                                                                 |
| [App5](App5) | A SwiftUI application which demonstrates how to write a UI test which interacts with a `DatePicker`.                           |
| [App6](App6) | A SwiftUI application which demonstrates how to schedule asynchronous work when a `Button` is tapped.                          |
| [App7](App7) | A SwiftUI application which demonstrates how to initialise an `ObservableObject` as a `StateObject` in a View's `init` method. |
