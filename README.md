# SwiftUI Experiments

This project houses a number of iOS applications which each demonstrate a particular aspect of SwiftUI.

The applications in this project are as follows:

* [App1](App1) – A SwiftUI application which demonstrates how to push, present and dismiss SwiftUI Views.
* [App2](App2) – A UIKit application which demonstrates a problem with presenting (i.e. modally) a `UIHostingController`.
* [App3](App3) – A SwiftUI application which demonstrates how to display an array of items with `List` and `LazyVStack`.
* [App4](App4) – A SwiftUI application which demonstrates a simple star rating view.
* [App5](App5) – A SwiftUI application which demonstrates how to write a UI test which interacts with a `DatePicker`.
