# SwiftUI Experiments

This project houses a number of iOS applications which each demonstrate a particular aspect of SwiftUI.

The applications in this project are as follows:

* [App1](App1) – A SwiftUI application which demonstrates how to push, present and dismiss SwiftUI Views.
* [App2](App2) – A UIKit application which demonstrates a problem with presenting (modally) a UIHostingController.
