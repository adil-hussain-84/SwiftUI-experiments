# SwiftUI `DatePicker` example

This SwiftUI application demonstrates how to write a UI test which interacts with a [DatePicker](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/datepicker). The UI test in this application taps on a [DatePicker](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/datepicker) to reveal the calendar-style popup, chooses a date in the popup and then dismisses the popup.

See the [ContentView](App5/ContentView.swift) and [App5UITests](App5UITests/App5UITests.swift) classes for the specifics.
