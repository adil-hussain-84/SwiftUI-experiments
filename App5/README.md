# SwiftUI `DatePicker` example

This SwiftUI application demonstrates how to tap on a [DatePicker](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/datepicker) in a UI test to reveal the calendar-style popup, to choose the desired date in the popup and then dismiss the popup.

See the [ContentView](App5/App5/ContentView.swift) and [App5UITests](App5/App5UITests/App5UITests.swift) classes for the specifics.
